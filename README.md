# Crack Detection using YOLOv7
This repository contains the code for a deep neural network that can detect cracks in images using the YOLOv7 architecture.

## Dataset
Datased used to train the network was provided as part of [ICUAS UAV Competition](http://www.uasconferences.com/2023_icuas/unmanned-aerial-vehicle-uav-competition/). The dataset consist out of 4998 images with labels written in YOLO labeling format.
